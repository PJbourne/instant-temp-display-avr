Shows real time temperaute on display + what button is pressed

I am working in a realease that stores in EEPROM medium temperatures by hour. I will post it in other repository.

See eletronic diagram below.
There are two situations I changed, both had a red and black CROSS and a CIRCLE under them. One is the 'Vo - display contrast' (exclude the diode and keep that open); Other is the 'Anode - display backlight (there is not parallel resistor, just only one)'

Using allcaline battery bank (6v) + resistor and potentiometer to set the needed 5v (I have not a LM7805 for now)
